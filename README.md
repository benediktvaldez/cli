# @benediktvaldez/cli

CLI for some arbitrary custom commands

## NOTE!

I made this first and foremost for personal use, solving some tensions I've run into (like having a preset of slack statuses, which isn't possible using their official interface). Feel free to use of course, but do so at your own peril. The code should be fairly straight forward to figure out.
